AI vs Human Text Classifier
This project uses a Naive Bayes classifier to classify text as either AI-generated or human-written. The model is trained on a dataset containing AI-generated and human-written text examples. By leveraging natural language processing techniques, the classifier aims to identify patterns and features that distinguish between the two categories. This project serves as a foundational approach to understanding how machine learning models can be used to differentiate between content generated by AI and humans.
